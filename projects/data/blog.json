    "content": "<p class='text-xl leading-relaxed'>Building a portfolio in 2025 requires more than just a collection of static images. It needs to be a living document, a testament to your skills that is both easy to update and engaging to explore. That was the core philosophy behind this very website.</p><p>Instead of hard-coding every project into the HTML, I opted for a decoupled architecture. All project data—from websites to AI models—is stored in simple JSON files. A set of dynamic HTML templates then fetches and renders this data on the fly. This approach has several key advantages:</p><ul class='list-disc list-inside my-6 space-y-2'><li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> Adding a new project is as simple as adding a new entry to a JSON file. No HTML editing required.</li><li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The same templates can render 10 or 100 projects without any code changes.</li><li><strong>Consistency:</strong> All project cards and pages are generated from the same logic, ensuring a uniform look and feel.</li></ul><h2 class='font-display text-3xl mt-8 mb-4'>The Technology Stack</h2><p>The entire portfolio is built on a foundation of pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enhanced by the utility-first power of Tailwind CSS. There's no complex backend or build process, making it lightweight and easy to deploy on any static hosting platform.</p><pre><code class='language-javascript'>// Simple fetch logic to load data\nasync function loadProjects(jsonURL) {\n  try {\n    const response = await fetch(jsonURL);\n    const projects = await response.json();\n    renderProjects(projects);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Failed to load projects:', error);\n  }\n}</code></pre><blockquote>This setup proves that you can achieve a highly dynamic and modern user experience without the overhead of heavy frameworks. It's all about smart architecture.</blockquote><p>The visual aesthetic—dark, futuristic, with glassmorphism and glowing effects—was a deliberate choice to reflect a forward-thinking approach to technology and design. Every animation, every hover effect, is designed to create a sense of depth and interactivity, making the exploration of the portfolio an experience in itself.</p>"

Whether physical or virtual, the overhead was significant. Serverless computing completely upends this model. It's not about having 'no servers'—it's about not having to manage them.</p><p>Platforms like AWS Lambda, Vercel Functions, and Google Cloud Functions allow you to deploy individual functions that execute in response to events. This event-driven architecture is incredibly powerful and offers several compelling benefits:</p><ul class='list-disc list-inside my-6 space-y-2'><li><strong>Infinite Scalability:</strong> The platform automatically scales your functions to handle any amount of traffic, from zero to millions of requests, without any intervention.</li><li><strong>Cost-Effectiveness:</strong> You only pay for the compute time you actually use, down to the millisecond.

You can focus purely on writing code that delivers value.</li></ul><h2 class='font-display text-3xl mt-8 mb-4'>A Practical Example</h2><p>Imagine a simple API endpoint for a contact form. In a traditional setup, you'd need a server running 24/7 just to listen for a request.

However, creating an effective dark theme is a nuanced process.</p><h2 class='font-display text-3xl mt-8 mb-4'>Key Principles of Dark UI Design</h2><p>Simply inverting colors or using a pure black background often leads to a poor user experience. Here are the principles I follow:</p><ul class='list-disc list-inside my-6 space-y-2'><li><strong>Avoid Pure Black:</strong> A background of `#000000` can create a harsh contrast with text, causing a halation effect that strains the eyes. Instead, use dark grays like `#121212` or deep blues. This gives your design more depth.</li><li><strong>Desaturate Colors:</strong> Bright, saturated colors that look great on a light background can be visually jarring on a dark one. Use desaturated, softer tones for accents and calls-to-action to ensure they are pleasant and accessible.</li><li><strong>Emphasize with Depth:</strong> In dark mode, you can't rely on shadows to create elevation. Instead, use varying shades of gray for different surface levels. The higher the surface, the lighter its gray should be.</li><li><strong>Test for Contrast:</strong> Accessibility is crucial. Ensure your text and UI elements meet WCAG contrast ratio guidelines against your dark background. This might mean your white text isn't pure white, but a slightly dimmer off-white.</li></ul><blockquote>Dark mode is an emotional and ergonomic choice. It should make the user feel comfortable and focused, allowing the content itself to shine.</blockquote>"

However, as web applications become more ambitious—tackling everything from 3D design to video editing—the performance limitations of an interpreted language can become a bottleneck.</p><p>This is where WebAssembly (Wasm) enters the stage. It's not a replacement for JavaScript, but rather a low-level, high-performance sidekick designed to work alongside it.</p><h2 class='font-display text-3xl mt-8 mb-4'>What Exactly is WebAssembly?</h2><p>At its core, <strong>WebAssembly is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine.</strong> That might sound complex, but the concept is straightforward:</p><ul class='list-disc list-inside my-6 space-y-2'><li>It’s a way to run code written in languages like C++, Rust, or Go directly in a web browser.</li><li>This code is compiled into a highly optimized, compact binary format (`.wasm` files).</li><li>The browser can execute this binary code at near-native speed, far faster than it can interpret traditional JavaScript.</li></ul><p>Crucially, you don't write WebAssembly by hand.

A company with a powerful C++ library for image processing doesn't need to rewrite it in JavaScript; they can compile it to Wasm and use it directly.</li><li><strong>A Secure Sandbox:</strong> Like JavaScript, Wasm runs in a secure, sandboxed environment within the browser, meaning it cannot access arbitrary parts of the user's computer. This ensures that its power doesn't come at the cost of security.</li></ul><blockquote>JavaScript is the flexible 'manager' of the web page, while WebAssembly is the 'specialist' called upon for the heavy lifting. Together, they are a perfect team.</blockquote><p>A common misconception is that Wasm is here to replace JavaScript. This couldn't be further from the truth. The typical workflow involves JavaScript loading a Wasm module and calling its functions to perform a heavy calculation. The result is then handed back to JavaScript to be displayed to the user. As browsers and the web platform continue to evolve, WebAssembly is steadily becoming a foundational technology, unlocking the next generation of powerful applications that run anywhere.</p>"

We've fine-tuned our JavaScript, compressed our images, and adopted serverless functions to scale our backends. But one fundamental bottleneck has remained: the physical distance between our users and our code. No matter how fast your server is, a request from Tokyo to a server in Virginia will always be slow.</p><p>This is the problem that Edge Computing solves. It's the next logical step in our quest for a faster, more resilient web, moving beyond centralized cloud computing to a truly global, decentralized model.</p><h2 class='font-display text-3xl mt-8 mb-4'>What Exactly *is* the Edge?</h2><p>Imagine a global Content Delivery Network (CDN) like Vercel or Cloudflare, which has servers in hundreds of cities around the world. Traditionally, these networks were used to cache static content like images and CSS files to deliver them quickly to nearby users.</p><p><strong>Edge Computing takes this one step further: it allows you to run your dynamic code—your serverless functions—on this same global network.</strong></p><p>Instead of your function living in a single region (e.g., `us-east-1`), it exists everywhere at once.

It scales automatically to handle traffic from any region, providing a consistent experience for all users.</li><li><strong>Enhanced Security & Reliability:</strong> Attacks like DDoS can be absorbed at the edge, long before they reach your origin servers or databases. If one edge location has an issue, traffic is automatically rerouted.</li></ul><blockquote>Edge functions are perfect for short-lived, latency-sensitive tasks that need to run close to the user, like A/B testing or authentication, with zero performance penalty.</blockquote><p>The Edge doesn't replace the serverless model you may already be using for your core business logic. Instead, it enhances it. By combining traditional serverless functions (located near your database) with edge functions (located near your users), you create a powerful, multi-layered architecture. It's about running the right code in the right place to build the next generation of truly fast, global applications.</p>"
